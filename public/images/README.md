# Images Folder

This folder contains the images used by the AI Summit website's mocked API response.

## Image Files

- `therapy-session.svg` - Professional therapy session with therapist and couple
- `couple-golden-hour.svg` - Couple on park bench during golden hour
- `hands-connection.svg` - Clasped hands in warm light with bokeh background
- `warm-interior.svg` - Cozy living room with plants and natural lighting

## Usage

These images are loaded by the JavaScript when the "Generate Images" button is clicked in the Customize sidebar. The first image becomes the logo, and the second image becomes the hero background.

## Note

Currently, these are placeholder files. In a real implementation, you would replace these with actual image files.
